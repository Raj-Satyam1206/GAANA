// $server_name: This variable holds the name of the server where your MySQL database is hosted. In this case, it's set to "localhost," which typically means the database is on the same server as the PHP script.

// $user_name: This variable stores the MySQL username used to connect to the database. In this case, it's set to 'root.' The 'root' user is a common default user for MySQL, especially in local development environments. In a production environment, you might want to use a more secure username with limited privileges.

// $user_pass: This variable stores the password associated with the MySQL user. In your example, it's an empty string (''). In a production environment, you should set a secure password for your database user.

// $database_name: This variable contains the name of the MySQL database to which you want to connect. In this case, it's set to "music_user."

// You would typically use these variables to establish a connection to the MySQL database using functions such as mysqli_connect or PDO (PHP Data Objects) functions in PHP.



$con = mysqli_connect($server_name, $user_name, $user_pass, $database_name);

if (!$con) {
    die('Connection Failed' . mysql_connect_error());
} 
// else {
//     echo ('Database Succesfully Connected');
// }

<!-- This code establishes a connection to the MySQL database using the mysqli_connect function and then checks if the connection was successful. If the connection fails, it will display an error message using mysqli_connect_error(). If the connection is successful, it will print the message "Database Successfully Connected. -->
